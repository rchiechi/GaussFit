# GaussFit

## Synopsis
This is a set of python scripts to parse I/V data, perform statistical analyses, generate plots and output parsed data as CSV files.
Most functions and options are available via a `tkinter` gui that you can call with `GaussFit.py -G`. The outputs of `GaussFit.py` have been tested extensively and, while the code is a mess, the results can be considered reliable provided all warning messages are heeded.

The `Stats.py` part is very much a work in progress, but it should, at the very least compute p-values using each file as a degree of freedom.
The `autonobs` command will try to guess time intervals and use those as degrees of freedom, but it relies on metadata in the input files and has only been tested with output containing this metadata in a very specific format. 

The commands for `GaussFit.py` and `Stats.py` are identical (with a few special options for `Stats.py`); launching with `-G` will get you a GUI in either case.

Although we have done some testing of the statsticaly functions, do not rely on this software without using some robust, external test of the veracity of the output!

### Input file format
GaussFit will try to guess the range of your *I/V* sweeps, but it works best with `0 -> + -> 0 -> â€“ ->0` (i.e., three zeros per trace).


### Caveats
Input files containing *I/V* sweeps with different voltage step-sizes will cause problems with Gaussian fits unless you have a ton of data.
Say you have 1,000 traces with 0.5 V steps and 100 with 0.25 V steps. You will end up with 1,100 points in the histogram at each 0.5 V
interval and only 100 at each 0.25 V interval, thus the reliatbility of the fits (and size of the error bars) will vary considerably.
`GaussFit.py` is fairly verbose by default and will summarize data that it cannot parse, that can safely be considered numerical artifacts (e.g., when computing derivatives) or that fall outside of a cut-off range specified by the user. It is vital to pay attention to this output to ensure that the majority of the input data are actually being parsed into the final outputs.

## Dependencies
```
python 3.4+
pandas
colorama
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
```

### Usage
You can just call the GUI with `GaussFit.py -G` and work from there.

To plot your data quickly without writing files:
```
GaussFit.py -n (-G) <files>
```
To write your data quickly and without plotting:
```
GaussFit.py -o <output name> (-G) <files>
```
To do both:
```
GaussFit.py -o <output name> -p (-G) <files>
```
